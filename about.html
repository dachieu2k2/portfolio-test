            It all started with an Aamlette. Quite literally.
            <br />
            <br />
            <img
              src="https://chupanhvn.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/25040524/anh-den-trang.png"
              alt="img "
              class="img-fluid w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded my-4"
            />
            Early on, as both Ashutosh and Archana were chasing conventional
            academic pursuits and harbouring a quiet acceptance to settling for
            an even more conventional career, it was that rare moment during the
            day (or night) wherein their creativity would spark – while cooking
            a quick meal consisting an Aamlette.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is some finesse and precision that go into making not only an
            appetising plate of Aamlette, but also visually appealing. Much like
            design.
            <br />
            <br />
            <img
              src="https://chupanhvn.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/25040524/anh-den-trang.png"
              alt="img "
              class="img-fluid w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded my-4"
            />
            It requires one to be creative and meticulous enough to understand
            the anatomy of a truly great Aamlette to serve it up with flair.
            Much like design.
            <br />
            <br />
            The late great Anthony Bourdain once said that the way you make an
            omelet reveals your character. And we couldn’t have agreed more. We
            take our design assignments as seriously as we do tossing our
            beloved Aamlettes.
            <br />
            <br />
            The culinary duo says, “Having worked together for almost a decade
            in the field of design, our pretty much every waking minute needs to
            satiate our urge to create and design. Just like you need a minimum
            of 2 eggs to sauté an Aamlette, you have at your disposal 2
            experienced creative minds to see your ideas to fruition.”
            <br />
            <br />
            They concur, “We believe in quality, not quantity. We work on
            selective projects at any given time. Which means, when we’re
            working on your project, we’re fully committed to it and not taking
            more work than we can focus on.”
